MyBB Notifier Client Application

1. Copy the "notifier.php" script file to your MyBB Root.

2. Edit the "notifier.php" and change the line that says "define('APIKEY', 'YOURKEY');" replacing YOURKEY with a secure private Key.

3. Run the "MyBB Notifier Client.exe" or add it to startup by pressing "Windows + R" then typing "shell:startup" and copying the "MyBB Notifier Client.exe" or creating a shortcut of "MyBB Notifier Client.exe" and copying the shortcut

4. Enter your "Script Location" and "API Key" (the key you set in step 2) in the apllication boxes. For example If you domain is cyanlabs.net and the forum is at the root and you set your APIKEY to 'cookies' the "Script Location" would be "http://cyanlabs.net/notifier.php" and the "API Key" would be "cookies"

5. Optionally change the "Interval" and then press the "Update Settings" button.

Enjoy, Any suggestions or bugs please post them in the MyBB Forum Thread or at http://cyanlabs.net
